# Thanos

**Thanos** commandâ€‘line tool that randomly deletes a specified number or percentage of files from a directory.

---

## Overview

Thanos allows you to:

- **Delete Files by Number or Percentage:**
  Choose to delete a fixed number of files using `-n` or a percentage of matching files using `-p` (these options are mutually exclusive).

- **Optional Filters:**
  - `-d <directory>`: Specify the target directory (defaults to the current directory).
  - `-m <regex>`: Only consider files whose names (or relative paths when using recursive mode) match the provided regular expression.
  - `-r`: Process files recursively in all subdirectories.

- **Safety Features:**
  - `--dry-run`: Display which files would be deleted without actually deleting them.
  - `--confirm`: Require confirmation before deleting each file.

- **No Arguments:**
  If no arguments are passed, Thanos displays a cool piece of ASCII art as an homage.
